üíé **Idea**

Enhancing urban reforestation and sustainable transportation by promoting tree planting in deforested areas and encouraging bicycle use. 

The platform leverages data from Copernicus and focuses on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to identify regions with reduced vegetation. Users are then prompted to contribute through donations, supporting tree-planting efforts to restore greenery across the city.

This data helps us identify regions with reduced vegetation, represented in light green colors.



   **Space for Environment & Green Transition**

**Carbon Footprint Reporting**

By promoting the use of bicycles over cars and supporting tree planting, the platform actively reduces carbon emissions. Trees absorb CO‚ÇÇ, while cycling eliminates vehicle emissions.

**Sustainable Living**

By the usage of bicycles, the platform fosters a culture of sustainability by encouraging eco-friendly transportation and supporting reforestation. It provides actionable steps‚Äîsuch as donating to plant trees or choosing bicycles‚Äîempowering users to adopt greener habits that contribute to long-term environmental sustainability.

**Climate Change Mitigation **

Tree planting directly addresses climate change by capturing atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ and restoring ecosystems. Additionally, promoting cycling reduces reliance on fossil fuels, cutting greenhouse gas emissions. These combined efforts support a healthier climate by reducing carbon output and improving urban resilience to environmental changes.
